# Base flavors. Use these when you can't think of anything.
# These are specifically flavors that are placed in front
# of other flavors. When the flavors are processed, these
# will go in front so you don't get this like "Tastes like tomatoes, sweet and spicy",
# instead, you get "Tastes sweet, spicy and like tomatoes".

# Complex flavors. Put a flavor here when you want something that's more
# specific.

# Food-specific flavors.
